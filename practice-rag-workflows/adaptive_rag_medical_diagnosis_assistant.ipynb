      "1. Medical Information/Analysis:\n",
      "Metformin is a medication commonly used to manage type 2 diabetes. It works by reducing the amount of glucose your liver releases into your bloodstream and helps your body respond better to insulin. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. Evidence Summary:\n",
      "According to the medical documents, the most common side effects of metformin include stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and a metallic taste in the mouth. These side effects often occur when starting the medication and may diminish over time. Less common but more serious side effects can include lactic acidosis (a build-up of lactic acid in the body), which is a medical emergency and requires immediate attention. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Safety Considerations:\n",
      "While metformin is generally safe for most people, it may not be suitable for those with severe kidney disease, liver disease, or heart disease. It's also not recommended for those who drink alcohol excessively. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. Recommendations:\n",
      "If you experience any of the common side effects and they persist or worsen, contact your healthcare provider.

      "URGENCY LEVEL: informational\n",
      "\n",
      "RESPONSE:\n",
      "1. Medical Information/Analysis:\n",
      "Recent research on Alzheimer's disease prevention has shifted from treatment to prevention strategies. The Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease (A4) Study, a phase 3 clinical trial of the drug candidate solanezumab, did not show significant results in slowing cognitive decline in cognitively healthy people at risk for Alzheimer’s. However, new chemical tools and strategies have been developed to engage a novel genetic target of dementia, which may help set the stage for future therapeutic development. Additionally, research by Stanford professor Tony Wyss-Coray shows potential to treat Alzheimer’s and prevent age-related cognitive decline through the transfusion of proteins found in the blood of young mice into older mice. Furthermore, a common variant in one gene has been found to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease in those at high genetic risk from a second gene.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Evidence Summary:\n",
      "The A4 Study, funded by NIH, involved more than 1,100 cognitively normal older adults who had brain amyloid. The results indicated that the drug solanezumab did not slow cognitive decline in these individuals. On the other hand, research by Stanford Medicine has found that a common variant in one gene reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease in those at high genetic risk from a second gene. This is the first demonstration of such a beneficial effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Safety Considerations:\n",
      "There are no specific safety alerts related to the information provided. However, it's important to note that these are research findings and not yet established treatments or prevention strategies. Any new treatment or prevention strategy should be thoroughly tested for safety and efficacy before being widely adopted.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Recommendations:\n",
      "While these findings are promising, it's important to continue following established guidelines for Alzheimer's prevention, which include maintaining a healthy lifestyle with regular physical activity, a balanced diet, mental stimulation, and regular check-ups. Individuals with a family history of Alzheimer's or other risk factors should consult with their healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Important Disclaimers:\n",
      "This information is based on recent research and does not constitute medical advice. It's important to consult with healthcare professionals for personalized medical advice. The research mentioned is in early stages and more studies are needed to confirm these findings and to determine their applicability to humans. The safety and efficacy of these potential prevention strategies have not yet been fully established.\n",
